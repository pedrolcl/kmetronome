You will need CMake 3.1 or newer.  If your Linux distribution
doesn't provide CMake, or if it provides an older version, you can get
it here:

    https://cmake.org/download/

There are ready to use binary packages available for Linux from
that page.  If you must build it from source, please read the instructions
supplied here:

    https://cmake.org/install/
    
This program needs the Drumstick libraries. You should install the development
package before trying to compile KMetronome. You can alternatively build
KMetronome statically linked to Drumstick, see the advanced build options.

Drumstick is available here:

    http://drumstick.sourceforge.net 
    
Building with CMake
-------------------

Unpack the tarball or check out CVS.  Assuming that you have the
source in ~/src/kmetronome, you need to change to that directory:

$ cd ~/src/kmetronome

Create a build directory, and change to it

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

Now run CMake to generate the build files.

$ cmake ..

Some variables you may want to set:

    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr 

    * CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:
      cmake .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/Qt/5.12.5/gcc_64/

If you are using your own compiled Drumstick source tree:

    * Drumstick_DIR:
      cmake .. -DDrumstick_DIR=$HOME/Projects/drumstick/build/

For example:

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

Look the configure.release and configure.debug scripts for more examples. 
If you prefer to avoid all this typing, you can use ccmake to view and change 
these options using a friendly curses-based interface:

$ ccmake ..

There is a GUI equivalent:

$ cmake-gui ..

Finally, run make, and then (sudo) make install, and you're done.

$ make
$ sudo make install

To uninstall, use:

$ sudo make uninstall

Advanced Build Options
----------------------

By default, make will output brief details of each build step.  If you
prefer to see full command lines, use:

$ make VERBOSE=1

Another option, useful for packagers, is setting DESTDIR at install
time. The DESTDIR directory will be prepended to the prefix when
copying the files:

$ make install DESTDIR=~/rpmroot

Dealing with Configuration Problems
-----------------------------------

First, look for an answer in CMake FAQ:
