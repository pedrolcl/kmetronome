# NAME

**kmetronome** - Drumstick MIDI metronome using ALSA sequencer and QT user interface

# SYNOPSIS

| **kmetronome** \[standard options]

# DESCRIPTION

Drumstick Metronome is a MIDI metronome with QT interface based on the
ALSA sequencer. It is a tool for musicians and music students to keep
the rhythm while playing musical instruments. It uses MIDI for sound
generation instead of digital audio, allowing low CPU usage, and very
accurate timing thanks to the ALSA sequencer.

## Standard Options

The following options apply to all Qt5 applications.

`-style=` style / `-style` style

:   Set the application GUI style. Possible values depend on the system
    configuration. If Qt is compiled with additional styles or has
    additional styles as plugins these will be available to the `-style`
    command line option.

`-stylesheet=` stylesheet / `-stylesheet` stylesheet

:   Set the application styleSheet. The value must be a path to a file
    that contains the Style Sheet.

`-widgetcount`

:   Print debug message at the end about number of widgets left
    undestroyed and maximum number of widgets existed at the same time.

`-reverse`

:   Set the application's layout direction to Qt::RightToLeft. This
    option is intended to aid debugging and should not be used in
    production. The default value is automatically detected from the
    user's locale (see also QLocale::textDirection()).

`-platform` platformName\[:options\]

`-platformpluginpath` path
